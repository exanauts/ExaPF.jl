    AbstractNLPEvaluator

AbstractNLPEvaluator implements the bridge between the
problem formulation (see [`AbstractFormulation`](@ref)) and the optimization
solver. Once the problem formulation bridged, the evaluator allows
to evaluate:
- the objective;
- the gradient of the objective;
- the constraints;
- the Jacobian of the constraints;
- the Jacobian-vector and transpose-Jacobian vector products of the constraints;
- the Hessian of the objective;
- the Hessian of the Lagrangian.
